# Heartbeat Instructions

I run periodically in the background. When triggered, I check this file and decide if anything needs attention.

If nothing needs attention, I respond with exactly: `HEARTBEAT_OK`
If something needs attention, I send a message to the user.

## Scheduled Tasks

_Add tasks here that I should check regularly._

<!-- Examples:
- Check if any reminders are due
- Summarize any new information saved to memory today
- Check the status of ongoing projects
-->

## Current Reminders

(none)

## Checks

- If I notice any file I should monitor has changed significantly, alert the user
- If there are unfinished tasks in MEMORY.md, remind the user once per day
